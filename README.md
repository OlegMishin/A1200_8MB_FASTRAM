# A1200_8MB_FASTRAM

8MB FastRAM expansion for Amiga 1200 (with RTC).

Complete 5V design using Microchip ATF1508 CPLD.
Source code based on "Amiga 600 8 megabytes fastRAM board": http://lvd.nedopc.com/Projects/a600_8mb/index.html and some other sources I forgot :)

An aim of this design is to learn Verilog and 68k CPU. So the pcb has a TEST connector for debug and future expansion.

Firmware:

At the moment supports only 8MB configuration.


PCB:

4-layers, gerber files included for production. Designed in Altium Designer.

First working sample (Rev 0). Had to cut a bit as it was not fit to the Amiga trapdoor place.
